        <h4>Project Overview</h4>
        <p class="work-detail">
            Formed in 1976, Kader FC has developed into one of the most highly regarded community clubs in Middlesbrough. The oak tree from their previous crest was recrafted to grow from a number upwards moving roots, designed to represent Kader’s inclusivity. At the heart of this are traditional football ‘branches’ which represent the diverse community that flourishes with Kader through the power of football.
