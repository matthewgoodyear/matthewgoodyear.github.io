<p>
    Hey! I'm Matthew. I have a passion for logo &amp; brand identity design. Since a young age I've always loved being creative, from developing websites and games to having a passion for photography. I studied graphic design at Cleveland College of Art and Design and had work experience at <a href="https://viacreative.co.uk/" target="_blank" class="via-link">Via Creative</a> before joining <a href="https://www.betterbrandagency.com/" class="better-link" target="_blank">Better</a>.
    <br><br>
    I've been lucky to work alongside experienced designers and be involved in a variety of projects, including logo design, editorial and naming strategy. Read more about my journey <a href="https://www.betterbrandagency.com/blog/2017/11/the-journey-of-a-junior-designer/" target="_blank">here</a>.
