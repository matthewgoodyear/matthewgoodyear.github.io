        <h4>Project Overview</h4>
        <p class="work-detail">
            Ian Kinnery is a professional business coach who works with leaders to promote behavioural change that allows their businesses to prosper. We created a more mature brand identity to better reflect Ianâ€™s wealth of knowledge. Materials for applications were carefully selected to reflect the natural landscape imagery used throughout the brand.
