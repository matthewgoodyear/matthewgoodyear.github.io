title: "Kader Football Club"
type: "Crest Design"
intro: "One of the most highly regarded grassroots football clubs in the UK, formed in 1976. We created a modern identity by recrafting the oak tree from their previous crest. The tree grows from a number upwards moving roots, designed to represent inclusivity and the various paths that people take. At the heart of this are traditional football ‘branches’ which represent the diverse community that flourish through the power of football."
launched: "August 2019"
