        <h4>Project Overview</h4>
        <p class="work-detail">
            Visualsoft is an e-commerce platform that builds, supports & Grows retailers online. We developed a down-to-earth, client centric identity that retains the equity built up in their previous identity. By using the core of logo as a brand devie, we could visually express putting clients at the centre of everything, and make e-commerce feel effortless.
