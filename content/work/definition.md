        <h4>Project Overview</h4>
        <p class="work-detail">
            Definition is national and international PR, Communications and Reputation Management Agency based in London, Harrogate and Dubai. The aim was to design a neutrally sophisticated and minimal brand that played on the concept of ‘definition’ by using light and shade. For business cards, we blind debossed their logo into thick ice white stock. The result is a wordmark that is literally defined by light, adapting to its surroundings in the same way that Definition adapts to its clients.
