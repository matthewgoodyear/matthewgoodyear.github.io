            The UKâ€™s largest and most connected industrial zone, built upon the site of the former Redcar steel works. We were challenged to create a brand identity that would encapsulate Teesworks' brand values and ambition for the future. The logo-mark features a circular icon symbolising transformation, sustainability and progress alongside colours that reflect the history and the future of the site.
